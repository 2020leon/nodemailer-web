In short, I am dumping the project. Most probably the current version 4.0.1 is going the be the last version of Nodemailer ever released.

This does not mean that I'm giving this project over to someone else. No, it just means that I won't work on it anymore. I'll keep the homepage up â€“ the advertising stuff in the left top corner of the page generates several tens of dollars a month which covers the server costs for any other stuff that I do and I do not want to give up this revenue.

I spent years of helping developers to resolve issues around sending emails with Nodemailer. Usually it was even the same complaint about Gmail which I had written about at least a thousand times but yeah, nobody RTFM anymore, so I had to spend countless hours explaining the same thing over and over. TBQH there were some valid issues as well that pointed out or even fixed errors in my mail protocol handling code but this was extremely rare. Mostly Gmail and to a lesser extent SES and it was always a configuration fault (invalid access scopes, ivalid IAM tokens etc.).
