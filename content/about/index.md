# Nodemailer

Nodemailer is an e-mail sending module for Node.js. Send e-mails with Node.js – easy as cake!

Initially it was meant to cover the void in the area of sending e-mails from Node.js – the project got started back in 2010 when there was no sane option to send e-mail messages. Nowadays it is the solution most Node.js users turn to by default.
