#### Before purchase

Nodemailer PRO is available under a restrictive license without a fee, so you are free to test Nodemailer PRO before actually buying anything. Sometimes there might be problems between the client software and SMTP server that are hard to resolve so it would be wise to try beforehand if Nodemailer PRO even works for you or not.

#### Contact

Contact sales [sales@kreata.ee](mailto:sales@kreata.ee) to purchase the license or if you have any other sales related questions.
