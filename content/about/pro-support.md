Support is available for Nodemailer subscribers. If you have trouble setting up or using Nodemailer, then contact [support@nodemailer.com](mailto:support@nodemailer.com).

### Custom work or support

I can help you to tweak Nodemailer to meet your specific requirements. Additionally I can help with debugging email related issues in general, be it with RFC822 formatting, IMAP protocol usage, SMTP protocol usage etc. I can't provide any help with HTML email design.

If you are running an email sending service then I can also create integration with your API for Nodemailer.

Price: **$160** per hour

To discuss details, email to [support@nodemailer.com](mailto:support@nodemailer.com)
