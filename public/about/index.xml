      <description>This migration document applies Migrating from Nodemailer 2 to Nodemailer 3 and to a lesser extent to 4
 Nodemailer v3 has dropped some features that were available in Nodemailer v2 and also introduced some new ones.
 All dependencies were dropped. There is exactly 0 dependencies needed to use Nodemailer. This brings the installation time of Nodemailer from NPM to less than 2 seconds All templating is gone. It was too confusing to use and to be really universal a huge list of different renderers would be required.</description>

      <description>Nodemailer v4+ is licensed under the MIT license.
Version 3 of Nodemailer used the European Union Public License 1.1 which is a copyleft license. You can read about the reasoning behind using EUPL for Nodemailer from the Nodemailer blog. After a two months long experiment I decided to cancel all active subscriptions of Nodemailer and changed the license back to MIT.
Keeping a lower level infrastructure module under a restrictive license has turned out to cause more trouble than gains â€“ I myself had to use older versions of Nodemailer for some client work to avoid any licensing conflicts.</description>
