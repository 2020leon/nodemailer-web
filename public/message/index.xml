      <title>Alternatives</title>

      <description>In addition to text and HTML, any kind of data can be inserted as an alternative content of the main body - for example a word processing document with the same text as in the HTML field. It is the job of the email client to select and show the best fitting alternative to the reader. Usually this field is used for calendar events and such.
If you want to use a calendar event as the alternative, the consider using the **icalEvent** option instead.</description>

      <description>All email addresses can be plain email addresses
&amp;#39;foobar@example.com&amp;#39;  or with formatted name (includes unicode support)  &amp;#39;Ноде Майлер &amp;lt;foobar@example.com&amp;gt;&amp;#39; Notice that all address fields (even *from:*) are comma separated lists, so if you want to use a comma (or any other special symbol) in the name part, make sure you enclose the name in double quotes like this: `&#39;&#34;Майлер, Ноде&#34; &#39;`   or as an address object (in this case you do not need to worry about the formatting, no need to use quotes etc.</description>

      <title>Calendar events</title>
      <link>https://nodemailer.com/message/calendar-events/</link>

      <description>Calendar events are tricky because different email clients handle these differently. Nodemailer uses the same style as Gmail for attaching calendar files which should ensure maximum compatibility. If you want to attach a calendar event to your email then you can use the message option icalEvent:
  icalEvent – an object to define calendar event
 method – optional method, case insensitive, defaults to &amp;lsquo;publish&amp;rsquo;. Other possible values would be &amp;lsquo;request&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;reply&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;cancel&amp;rsquo; or any other valid calendar method listed in RFC5546.</description>

      <title>Embedded images</title>
      <link>https://nodemailer.com/message/embedded-images/</link>

      <guid>https://nodemailer.com/message/embedded-images/</guid>
      <description>Attachments can be used as embedded images in the HTML body. To use this feature, you need to set additional property of the attachment - cid (unique identifier of the file) which is a reference to the attachment file. The same cid value must be used as the image URL in HTML (using cid: as the URL protocol, see example below).
**NB!** the cid value should be as unique as possible!</description>

      <title>List headers</title>
      <link>https://nodemailer.com/message/list-headers/</link>

      <guid>https://nodemailer.com/message/list-headers/</guid>
      <description>Nodemailer includes a helper for setting more complex List-* headers with ease. You can use this by providing message option list. It&amp;rsquo;s an object where key names are converted into list headers. List key help becomes List-Help header etc.
General rules
 If the value is a string, it is treated as an URL If you want to provide an optional comment, use {url:&amp;lsquo;url&amp;rsquo;, comment: &amp;lsquo;comment&amp;rsquo;} object If you want to have multiple header rows for the same List-* key, use an array as the value for this key If you want to have multiple URLs for single List-* header row, use an array inside an array List-* headers are treated as pregenerated values, this means that lines are not folded and strings are not encoded.</description>

      <title>Custom headers</title>

      <guid>https://nodemailer.com/message/custom-headers/</guid>
      <description>Most messages do not need any kind of tampering with the headers. If you do need to add custom headers either to the message or to an attachment/alternative, you can add these values with the headers option. Values are processed automatically, non-ascii strings are encoded as mime-words and long lines are folded.
 headers – is an object of key-value pairs, where key names are converted into message header keys  Examples 1.</description>

      <guid>https://nodemailer.com/message/custom-source/</guid>
      <description>If you want to use your own custom generated RFC822 formatted message source, instead of letting Nodemailer to generate it from the message options, use option raw. This can be used both for the entire message or alternatively per-attachment or per-alternative.
Don&#39;t forget to set the **envelope** option when using **raw** as the message source  Examples 1. Use string as a message body This example loads the entire message source from a string value.</description>
